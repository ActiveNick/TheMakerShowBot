# TheMakerShowBot
This bot helps you get started as a maker by recommending online resources about project ideas, where to buy hardware boards, sensors and other parts, and more. This bot also recommends specific episodes of The Maker Show to watch based on your interests.

The bot is built in C# with Visual Studio 2015 and ASP.NET Web API using the open source Bot Builder SDK. For more information about building bots, see https://dev.botframework.com/.

The bot supports a few intents, such as:
- Learn a Topic: e.g. How can I get started with Arduino?
- Buy Hardware: e.g. Where can I buy a Raspberry Pi?
- Greeting: e.g. Hi there!
- Help: e.g. What can I say?
 
The live version of this bot is hosted in Azure App Services at http://themakershowbot.azurewebsites.net. The bot is already live (though not yet visibly published) via Facebook Messenger and Skype.
